## **Data explanation**
<p>
The billionaires dataset [1] comprises a list of World‚Äôs billionaires. A data frame with 2615 rows over three years 1996, 2001 and 2014 on average of 829 number of billionaires, on 22 numerical and categorical variables.

* According to Whitcom [2], this list was built off the Forbes World‚Äôs Billionaires list from 1996-2014 and then scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire. Also, as reported by CORGIS [3], this dataset was stored to be used and picked up for introductory computing students. The variables‚Äô names and descriptions are shown in [1, Tab. I] and the data sample is depicted in Table II.
* It belongs to the CORGIS Dataset project and has GNU General Public Licence v2.0 [4]. Therefore, this license grants the permissions to update, distribute and use the dataset as long as the user acknowledges license and copyright. It doesn‚Äôt contain sensitive data so values are not encrypted.
* It‚Äôs stored in a single csv file inside the github repository and it doesn‚Äôt use any compression.
* It represents encouraging data because anyone could see how billionaires were making money along these three years through performing important roles in decision making in their companies.
* It was created on May 17th, 2016 and it‚Äôs not live data.
* A sample of 6 lines of the billionaires dataset is shown in Tables II. This sample include correctly formatted values and also examples of missing values and errors. It shows these values and how the data
was stored.

## **Data composition**
<p>
We could see some important features about dataset composition as follows:
Billionaires dataset comprises some data types of variables as seen in [1, Tab. II]. Some formats for numerical values use scientific notation since they are large numbers as shown in Table II.

* Examples, types and variables of this dataset are shown in [1, Tab. II].
* It includes raw data and neither function nor algorithm was used to store the data.
* As reported by Whitcom [2], it‚Äôs compiled from some databases and then it was added some variables.
* Decimal places for float values are suitable for wealth worth since the values use billions scale and are easy to read.
* It has some wrong values, uncertain and missing values as seen in [1,Table II]. For instance, wrong values in demographics age are represented as 0 or negative values. Missing values are represented by blanks like some company name values. Also, uncertain values are marked with a question symbol.
* Its last version is 2.0.0.
