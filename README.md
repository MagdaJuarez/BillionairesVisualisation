<p>
A project that implements a Billionaires poster which includes a nice visualisation. The billionaires data set contains information about World's billionaires in 1996, 2001 and 2014.

## Introduction
<p>
Visualisations are powerful and ubiquitous tools which helps user to better understand amounts of data and allows telling interesting stories. Hence, some steps must be followed as follows : 

1. Analysis of the data set to find out if our data set is suitable to support our storytelling.
2. Sketching several ideas by combining different retinal variables such as length, color, area and shape. 
3. Refinement and implementation of our main visualisation.

At the end, we developed a poster that includes the implemented visualisation and additional elements to support our storytelling. Nevertheless, we evaluated our poster using a Critical Design Survey to self evaluate and reflect about our poster design.
